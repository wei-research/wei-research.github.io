"This smartphone has everything I was looking for and more. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp resolution, making videos and photos look incredible. The camera is one of the best I’ve ever used on a phone, capturing detailed images even in low light. The battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day with heavy use. The phone is fast and responsive, handling all my apps without any lag.",1
"I bought this tablet for my daughter to use for school, but it has been nothing but trouble. The screen is unresponsive at times, and it crashes frequently, even when just browsing the web. The battery life is abysmal, lasting only a couple of hours before needing to be recharged. It also takes forever to charge, which is incredibly frustrating.",0
"I recently purchased this blender after doing a lot of research, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The build quality is exceptional, and it handles everything from smoothies to soups with ease. Even the frozen fruits are no challenge for this powerhouse. The sleek design also looks great on my kitchen counter, and the noise level is surprisingly low. I’ve used it daily for a month now, and it still works like new. Highly recommended for anyone serious about their kitchen.",1
"I decided to buy this hair dryer because it promised quick drying time and professional results, but it’s done nothing but damage my hair. The heat settings are either too low to dry my hair or so high that they cause my hair to become frizzy and brittle. The dryer is also extremely heavy and awkward to use, making it difficult to maneuver.",0

"I purchased this camera for my recent trip to Europe, and it captured stunning photos that I’ll cherish forever. The image quality is superb, with vibrant colors and incredible detail. The autofocus is fast and accurate, making it easy to get the perfect shot every time. The battery life is also excellent; I was able to take over 500 photos on a single charge. It’s lightweight and easy to carry, yet feels solid and durable. The Wi-Fi feature is a bonus, allowing me to transfer photos to my phone.",1
"I was looking for a reliable and stylish watch for daily wear, and this one exceeded all my expectations. The design is classic yet modern, and it goes well with both casual and formal outfits. The watch is comfortable to wear all day, and the build quality feels premium. The timekeeping is accurate, and I love the fact that it's water-resistant.",1
"After years of struggling with subpar cookware, I finally invested in this set of non-stick pans, and it has revolutionized my cooking experience. The non-stick coating is truly non-stick, making cooking and cleaning a breeze. Even sticky sauces and melted cheese slide right off without leaving any residue. The pans heat up evenly and quickly, allowing me to cook meals faster without burning.",1
"This washing machine has been nothing but trouble since the day it was installed. It constantly goes off balance during the spin cycle, making a loud banging noise that shakes the entire room. The clothes come out soaking wet, even on the highest spin setting, and the machine takes forever to complete a cycle. I’ve had to call a repair technician three times in the past two months, but the issues persist.",0
"This vacuum cleaner has made my weekly cleaning routine so much easier and faster. The suction power is incredible, picking up everything from pet hair to crumbs with ease. It works equally well on carpets and hardwood floors, and the attachments are perfect for getting into tight corners and under furniture. The dustbin is easy to empty, and the filter system does a great job of trapping dust and allergens.",1

"I bought this laptop for work and couldn't be happier with my purchase. The screen resolution is crisp, and the performance is lightning fast even when I have multiple tabs and applications open. The battery life is also impressive, lasting me through an entire day of meetings without needing a charge. The lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, and it’s been a game-changer for my productivity. I was initially hesitant because of the price, but it’s proven to be worth every penny.",1

"I purchased this ergonomic office chair for my home office, and it has been a lifesaver for my back. The adjustable lumbar support provides just the right amount of pressure, and the seat is comfortable for long hours of work. The armrests are also adjustable, and the chair swivels smoothly, making it easy to move around my workspace.",1

"I was excited to try this new coffee maker, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The machine leaks water from the bottom every time I use it, and the coffee doesn't brew evenly. Some cups are weak while others are too strong. The worst part is the noise—it sounds like a jet engine taking off. I contacted customer service, but they were unhelpful and refused to offer a replacement.",0

"I was excited to try this new toaster, but it was a complete letdown. The toast comes out unevenly browned, with some parts burnt and others barely toasted. The slots are too small to fit larger slices of bread, and the toaster itself feels flimsy and cheap. It also takes much longer than expected to toast anything, even on the highest setting.",0

"I purchased this lawn mower because of the positive reviews, but it has been a huge disappointment. The engine is underpowered and struggles to cut through even moderately thick grass. It frequently stalls, and restarting it is a hassle. The cutting deck is also poorly designed, leaving uneven patches of grass no matter how many times I go over the same area.",0
"I bought this gaming chair hoping it would be comfortable for long sessions, but it’s been a huge letdown. The padding is thin and doesn’t provide enough support, causing my back to ache after just an hour of sitting. The armrests are wobbly and feel like they could break off at any moment. The chair also doesn’t recline smoothly—it jerks and makes a loud noise whenever I try to adjust it.",0

"As someone who travels frequently, I needed a suitcase that could withstand the rigors of constant use, and this one has not disappointed. The hard-shell design is incredibly durable, protecting my belongings from rough handling during flights. The wheels glide smoothly, making it easy to maneuver through crowded airports, and the expandable feature provides extra space when I need it.",1

"This mattress has completely transformed the way I sleep. I was struggling with back pain for years, and after using this mattress for just a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement. It provides the perfect balance between softness and support, and I wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free. The material is also breathable, which helps keep me cool throughout the night. I was worried about buying a mattress online without trying it first, but the return policy gave me peace of mind.",1

"I bought this tablet for my daughter to use for school, but it has been nothing but trouble. The screen is unresponsive at times, and it crashes frequently, even when just browsing the web. The battery life is abysmal, lasting only a couple of hours before needing to be recharged. It also takes forever to charge, which is incredibly frustrating.",0
"This smartwatch was supposed to help me track my fitness goals, but it’s been nothing but a headache. The step counter is inaccurate, often counting steps when I’m just sitting still. The heart rate monitor is also unreliable, giving wildly different readings within minutes. The battery life is terrible, requiring a charge almost every day, and the screen is difficult to read in sunlight.",0
"This mattress has completely transformed the way I sleep. I was struggling with back pain for years, and after using this mattress for just a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement. It provides the perfect balance between softness and support, and I wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free. The material is also breathable, which helps keep me cool throughout the night. I was worried about buying a mattress online without trying it first, but the return policy gave me peace of mind.",1
"I was excited to try this new coffee maker, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The machine leaks water from the bottom every time I use it, and the coffee doesn't brew evenly. Some cups are weak while others are too strong. The worst part is the noise—it sounds like a jet engine taking off. I contacted customer service, but they were unhelpful and refused to offer a replacement.",0
"I bought this laptop for work and couldn't be happier with my purchase. The screen resolution is crisp, and the performance is lightning fast even when I have multiple tabs and applications open. The battery life is also impressive, lasting me through an entire day of meetings without needing a charge. The lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, and it’s been a game-changer for my productivity. I was initially hesitant because of the price, but it’s proven to be worth every penny.",1

"I purchased this camera for my recent trip to Europe, and it captured stunning photos that I’ll cherish forever. The image quality is superb, with vibrant colors and incredible detail. The autofocus is fast and accurate, making it easy to get the perfect shot every time. The battery life is also excellent; I was able to take over 500 photos on a single charge. It’s lightweight and easy to carry, yet feels solid and durable. The Wi-Fi feature is a bonus, allowing me to transfer photos to my phone.",1

"I decided to buy this hair dryer because it promised quick drying time and professional results, but it’s done nothing but damage my hair. The heat settings are either too low to dry my hair or so high that they cause my hair to become frizzy and brittle. The dryer is also extremely heavy and awkward to use, making it difficult to maneuver.",0
"This refrigerator has been a nightmare since the day it was delivered. It makes a loud humming noise that can be heard throughout the house, and the temperature inside fluctuates constantly, causing my food to spoil. The ice maker also stopped working after just a month, and I’ve had to call for repairs multiple times. The shelves are poorly designed and not adjustable.",0
"I was excited to try this new toaster, but it was a complete letdown. The toast comes out unevenly browned, with some parts burnt and others barely toasted. The slots are too small to fit larger slices of bread, and the toaster itself feels flimsy and cheap. It also takes much longer than expected to toast anything, even on the highest setting.",0
